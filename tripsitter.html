            <h2>Market Research</h2>
            <div class="row2"></div>
            <h3>The Stats</h3>
            <p>Approximately 1.5 billion people take vacation trips yearly. More than 75% of people use a smartphone app
                to plan and book their trips generating 798 billion dollars annually in revenue. </p>
                <div class="row"></div>
            <h3>The Problem</h3>
            <p>One of most stressful parts of traveling is actually planning the trip itself. While there are many apps
                specifically used for booking flights, accommodations and activities, very few combine these travel
                details in one easily accessible app. </p>

            <h2>Competitor Analysis</h2>
            <div class="row2"></div>
            <p>I analyzed 3 top travel apps in the space- looking at how these apps organized travel plans and how they
                connect users to traveling resources. </p>
                <div class="row"></div>
            <h3>The Pros</h3>
            <p>Most apps have the ability to search for housing and accommodations. They allow you to save content for
                later reference. </p>
                <div class="row"></div>
            <h3>The Cons</h3>
            <p>Lack interface to remind you of events during a trip and create a unified itinerary. Do not allow you to
                manually enter activity information. Navigation and organization are confusing. </p>

            <p>Even though most users were able to complete the tasks, there were certain design elements that could be
                modified with better usability throughout the app. The main focus of the reiteration would be connecting
                different tasks within the app at key screens with navigational tabs. There were also small changes that
                would help interacting with certain elements more accessible. .</p>

            <p>After reiterating components of the app with feedback from user testing, I began to define the main
                colors, fonts and other characteristics of the app into a style guide. I chose the the colors because
                they promote a relaxing feel with a hint of vibrancy.</p>

            <h2>Project Reflection</h2>
            <div class="row2"></div>
            <p>Much like this project, the process of traveling has many challenges but the destination is always worth
                it! This project had a large scope in terms of defining what problem users face with regards to travel
                and the best way to go about improving it. Since there are so many variables when traveling, the biggest
                challenge was defining and ideating the most important features that would help users. Spending the
                time, effort and energy to produce a high fidelity prototype with clearly defined features resulted in a
                more insightful user testing experience. It is invaluable to be able to pinpoint the pain points of
                users with a high fidelity iterations and be able to improve specific parts. With feedback from users
                and utilizing foundational UX design and thinking, I developed a mock product that I believe could be a
                start to solve a real world problem and improve the experience of travel. Thank you for your time!</p>
